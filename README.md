# Health Check Lambda for Cerberus

This is a quick and dirty Node Lambda to run an end-to-end test of the general health of a production 
[Cerberus](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/) environment. It checks that an EC2 instance or in
this case a Lambda can [authenticate](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/docs/architecture/authentication)
with Cerberus which will exercise [CMS](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-management-service) and its RDS DB. It then uses that auth
token to read from the healthcheck Safe Deposit Box (SDB) which will exercise and test that Vault and Consul are up and running.

To learn more about Cerberus, please see the [Cerberus website](http://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/).

## Building

Give values to these settings in index.js.

```javascript
    var region = ''
    var acctId = ''
    var roleName = ''
    var host = ''
```

All the magic is in index.js, deps are in package.json if you need to add a dep use the normal `npm install --save xxxxxxx`
To build run `npm run package` this will create a healthcheck.zip package that can be used to upload into the lambda function.
